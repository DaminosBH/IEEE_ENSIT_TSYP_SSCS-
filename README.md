## Project Overview

The IEEE SSCS Air Quality Monitor is designed to address the critical issue of air pollution. It features a comprehensive PCB design with sensors for particulate matter, temperature-humidity, and indoor CO2 levels. The MikroC project provides data processing capabilities and interfaces with the PCB for real-time monitoring.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project file (**IEEEE ENSIT SB SSCS.PrjPcb**) using your preferred PCB design tool.
3. Explore the schematic design, PCB layout, and bill of material files to understand the hardware components.
4. The MikroC project file (**SSCS IEEE.mcppi**) contains the embedded software for the air quality monitor.
